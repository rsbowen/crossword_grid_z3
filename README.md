crossword_grid_z3 is a tool for creating unfilled crossword grids subject to certain constraints.

For example, perhaps you have 4 theme clues of 8 letters each in mind. Then what you would like is a 15x15 grid with exactly 4 8-letter clues.

The code is very rough right now; it's set up to solve the exact problem above. You would need to tweak various constants to get it to work for other constraints.

To install, you need z3py. See https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3
